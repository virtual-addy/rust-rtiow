# Ray Tracing In One Weekend (Rust Impl)

This is an implementation of the Ray Tracing In One Weekend using Rust.

There exists only one branch but with multiple commits for keypoint in building the codebase.
To execute and see the output, a convenient `.sh` script has been added to generate a `.ppm` image file output for each execution.

### Execute and output image file
```shell
sh render.sh
```
