# Ray Tracing In One Weekend - Book Series (Rust Implementation)

This is an implementation of the [Ray Tracing In One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) book series using Rust.

### Structure
- master - contains all changes with commits for each progression
- `book-1`: contains all changes from the first book `Ray Tracing in One Weekend`
- `book-2-{section}`: contains only the changes for the section in book 2 `Ray Tracing: The Next Week`

To execute and see the output, a convenient `.sh` script has been added to generate a `.ppm` image file output for each execution.

### Execute and output image file
```shell
sh render.sh
